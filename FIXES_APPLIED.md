# Fixes Applied - Tracy AI App

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Speech Recognition Errors (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: Multiple speech recognition instances causing errors like "recognition has already started" and "network" errors.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper cleanup in `voice-listener.tsx`
- Prevented multiple instances from starting
- Added timeout management for restarts
- Added error handling for permission denied scenarios
- Added proper cleanup in useEffect return function

### 2. Journal Page Crashes (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: Infinite loop in `useJournal` hook causing the journal page to crash with "Maximum update depth exceeded" error.

**Solution**:
- Fixed infinite loop in `app/journal/page.tsx` by separating useEffect dependencies
- Made `fetchEntries` function stable using `useCallback` in `hooks/use-journal.ts`
- Removed problematic hook calls from `functional-action-buttons.tsx` that were causing re-renders
- Added proper dependency management to prevent infinite re-renders

### 3. Removed Jarvis Floating Button (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: Purple/blue floating chat button appearing in bottom-right corner.

**Solution**:
- Removed `JarvisProvider` import and usage from `app/layout.tsx`
- This removes the floating chat button and voice listener from the global layout
- Users can still access Jarvis features through the Profile page Google sync buttons
