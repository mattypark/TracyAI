# Calendar and Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Event Creation Page Reloads ✅
**Problem**: Creating calendar events caused the entire website to reload due to `window.location.reload()` calls.

**Solution**:
- Removed all `window.location.reload()` calls from event creation modals
- Implemented custom event system using `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('calendarEventCreated'))`
- Added event listeners in calendar components to refresh data without page reload
- Updated both `GoogleCalendarModal` and `EventModal` components

### 2. Database Persistence ✅
**Problem**: Events were only created locally and not saved to the database, causing data loss on app restart.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `lib/database.ts` `createCalendarEvent` method to actually save to Supabase
- Updated calendar loading functions to fetch real data from database
- Fixed authentication flow to ensure user context is available
- Updated `calendar-view.tsx`, `calendar-grid.tsx`, and `upcoming-events-sidebar.tsx` to load real data

### 3. Welcome Screen Bypass ✅
**Problem**: Dashboard kept showing "Welcome to Tracy" screen instead of going straight to the main dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Modified `components/scrollable-dashboard.tsx` to skip new user check
- Set `isNewUser = false` to always show main dashboard
- Removed dependency on journal entries and tasks for dashboard display

### 4. Calendar Sidebar Structure ✅
**Problem**: Calendar sidebar was organized by flags instead of Google Calendar-style "My calendars" and "Other calendars".

**Solution**:
- Updated `app/calendar/page.tsx` sidebar structure
- Replaced flag-based organization with Google Calendar-style layout:
  - **My calendars**: Personal, Work, Health, Social
  - **Other calendars**: Holidays in United States, Birthdays
- Added proper color coding and checkboxes for each calendar

### 5. Database Schema Updates ✅
**Problem**: Calendar events table was missing required columns for new functionality.

**Solution**:
- Created `scripts/update-calendar-schema.sql` to add missing columns:
  - `flag_name` (TEXT)
  - `flag_color` (TEXT) 
  - `guests` (TEXT)
  - `link` (TEXT)
  - `all_day` (BOOLEAN)
- Added default values for existing records

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Creation Flow
1. User fills out event form in `GoogleCalendarModal` or `EventModal`
2. Form data is validated and processed
3. Event is saved to Supabase `calendar_events` table via `db.createCalendarEvent()`
4. Custom event `'calendarEventCreated'` is dispatched
5. Calendar components listen for this event and refresh their data
6. UI updates without page reload

### Database Integration
- All calendar components now use real database queries
- Proper error handling for authentication and database errors
- Consistent data transformation between database and UI interfaces
- User-specific data filtering with RLS policies

### Performance Improvements
- Eliminated unnecessary page reloads
- Implemented efficient event-driven updates
- Reduced database calls with proper caching
- Improved user experience with instant feedback
